Go, also called golang, is a programming language initially developed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
The authors of Go! describe it as "a multi-paradigm programming language that is oriented to the needs of programming secure, production quality, agent based applications.
The authors propose that the language is suitable for representing ontologies due to its integration of logic, functional and imperative styles of programming
In November 2009, Google released a similarly named Go programming language (with no exclamation point). McCabe asked Google to change the name of their language as he was concerned they were "steam-rolling over us".[1][4] The issue received attention among technology news websites, with some of them characterizing Go! as "obscure".[5] The issue thread opened on the subject was closed by a Google developer on 12 October 2010 with the custom status "Unfortunate" and with the following comment: "there are many computing products and services named Go. In the 11 months since our release, there has been minimal confusion of the two languages."
